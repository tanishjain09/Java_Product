# 🧾 Extensible Invoice & Tax Engine (Java OOP Console Project)

🚧 **Status: Under Development**  
This is a **Java-based console application** for generating customer invoices with an extensible tax engine based on country-specific rules. It demonstrates object-oriented principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

❗ **Note:**  
- Tax is calculated based on the customer's country
